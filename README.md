- âš¡ Fun fact:The shortest war in history lasted only 38 minutes! It was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896. The conflict arose when Sultan Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar refused to step down as ruler and instead declared himself Sultan. In response, the British issued an ultimatum, demanding his abdication. When the deadline passed without compliance, British warships bombarded the Sultan's palace, effectively ending the rebellion and the war in less than an hour.
